## What is it?
This app track conenctions of the system/or selected application and shows the detailed IP information with an ability to block the connection for the specific address (default Windows firewall should be enabled to do so).

## Why?
Well, sometimes you might need to track what connections are being established by the given application. Sometimes you may want to block some of them.

## Where is it useful?
- In VOIP to see what's going on.
- In some games to abuse poor self-hosting system and kick people you don't want to play with (e.g. Warframe).
- To reveal someone IP and extra geo information.
