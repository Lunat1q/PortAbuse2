   Yes, I'm kinda lazy to make the software itself to handle that.

## Why?
Well, sometimes you might need to track what connections are being established by the given application. Sometimes you may want to block some of them.

## Where is it useful?
- In VOIP to see what's going on.
- In some games to abuse poor self-hosting system and kick people you don't want to play with (e.g. Warframe).
- To reveal someone IP and extra geo information.

## Hotkeys
`Ctrl` + `P` - Bring to the top and make it the topmost.
`Ctrl` + `B` - Block all new connections for the current application.
